                        <p>The initial objective of this research in 2019 was to generate nationwide estimates of physical activity and sedentary time in United States adults using the ACT24 instrument.  The data collection in the Fall of 2019 was successful yielding several descriptive papers.  The COVID19 pandemic hit a few months later.  We then expanded our efforts to investigate if and/or how patterns of behavior changed after the pandemic onset and collected a second round of data in the Fall of 2020.</p>

                        <p>Participants were from <a href="https://www.norc.org/content/dam/norc-org/pdfs/AmeriSpeak Technical Overview 2015 11 25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AmeriSpeak Panel</a>, a probability-based panel designed to represent the US population. The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago developed, maintains, and gathers IRB approved informed consent for AmeriSpeak when participants enroll in the panel, which was obtained in-person, by mail, or through a website.</p>
                        <p>The NORC team collected data for all the projects by contacting a general sample of panelists 20-75 years of age who could complete online surveys.</p>

                        <p>Data collection was completed between October 16 and November 11, 2019.  On an unannounced randomly selected day of the week, participants were sent electronic invitations to complete the short survey (online) and a previous-day recall.  Those completing the first recall were sent an unannounced invitation to complete a second recall 1â€“2 weeks later.  Recalls could only be completed on the targeted recall day and no make-up recalls/invitations were attempted.</p>

                        <p>All participants in the 2019 survey who were still active in 2020 were invited to participate.  Additionally, XXXX individuals who did not participate in the earlier survey were also invited to participate in 2020.  Between November 3 and Nov 15, 2020, panelists were sent e-invitations to complete a short online-survey and one unannounced 24-hour recall on a randomly selected day.  Recalls could only be completed on the targeted recall day and no make-up recalls/invitations were attempted.</p>
